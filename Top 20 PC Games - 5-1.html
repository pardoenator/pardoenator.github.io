    <h1 class="gametitlerating">5) Just Cause 3</h1>
    <p class="gamereview">
    In my eyes Just Cause 3 is the best open world game ever made, a lot better than the GTA franchise. This is 
	because with Just Cause 3 everything is over the top. There are massive explosions, 
    over the top guns, the parachute, the grapple hook and the wing suit. When you have all of these combined it is the best and most fun game ever. The location in the latest 
	installment of this
    game is Medici, almost everything is destructible and the look and feel of the map and atmosphere is amazing. The gameplay is another really fun aspect of this game, you get to get a gun or some
    explosives and blow up almost anything you see. Another great point about the gameplay is that it does not get repetitive 
	because the bases you have to liberate are all different and the use of 
    the parachute and wing suit is not the only way you can get around. There is only one downside about this game, the engine does not support SLi, even if you force it in the control panel, if you
    try this then the shadows flicker all the time. But apart from that downside it is highly 
	recommended that you get this game.

<h1 class="gametitlerating">4) Fallout 3</h1>
    <p class="gamereview">
		Fallout 3 was a game changer for the Fallout series. The game had the best gameplay you could find on the game at the 
		time. Even though now there are some things lacking, like the ability 
		to look down the iron sights properly and weapons modifications. This can be solved easily by using third party mods. The gameplay is like the gameplay in Fallout 4, the only difference
		is the graphics, however, the physics stay the same, the limbs of your 
		enemies will still come off when shot at and heads will still explode. The reason that this game is higher on the list 
		than the newer Fallout 4 is simple, Fallout 3 is better because it was the first game to use these kind of mechanics and it is a lot more stable. Fallout 4 is still very buggy in parts and it 
		is just reusing the old mechanics from this Fallout and Fallout New Vegas.

<h1 class="gametitlerating">3) Project Cars</h1>
<p class="gamereview">
Project Cars is one of my all time favorite games. This is because the simulation is so real, you 
feel like you are actually driving in a Audi R8 V10 around Bathurst. Not only that but the game is cramped pack
full of content, cars from the ordinary Ford Focus RS to the high performance Track Day BAC MONO. It is the same with the tracks, you can drive around 
Silverstone, Bathurst, Brands Hatch and many more. The only 
thing it is missing is the Top Gear Test Track, but this is due to license issues, so not really the developers fault. There are also different weather and time settings you can set for a free race, which includes
a mixture of weather, so it will change in the race. And because it is a simulation there are loads of car 
telemetry, which shows practically anything about the car while you race. Also 
because of this each car
feels and performs differently, right down to the gear ratios, so you have to adapt for each car. If you love racing in fast cars and simulation games then this is a perfect game for you.

<h1 class="gametitlerating">2) Dirt Rally</h1>
<p class="gamereview">
Dirt Rally is the best Code Masters game since the first ToCA Race Drivers and Colin Mcrea's Rally games. It ditches all of the aspects of the previous Dirt games and goes back to the old 
formula of simulation and good old classic rally stages with new cars, graphics and physics simulation. The cars handle beautifully and 
realistically, they also look amazing. The level of 
detail on the stages and tracks are also amazing. Dirt Rally is basically the Rally version of Project Cars. This goes right down to setting the times of day and levels on the stages. Not only
is there classic rally stages there are also rallycross event and a hill climb event. Now I have not played this since February of 2016, but since then they have doubled the content, so there is 
even more than what is written in this review. If you loved the old Colin Mcrea Rally games or even the Dirt games this is 
defiantly a high recommendation.

<h1 class="gametitlerating">1) Half Life 2</h1>
<p class="gamereview">
Half Life 2 was the first FPS game i played on my PC. I absolutely loved it and played it literally to death, so now it has gotten boring 
and repetitive. however, despite of that it is still a big recommendation
this is not only because of the gameplay it is also because of the amazing story line of Gordan Freeman. There are amazing physics and a great selection of mods from the community. This is the game 
that GMod spawned from. There are a wide selection of weapons, from a Crowbar to the Gravity Gun. However to understand the story line you really need to look up the story line of the first Half Life, 
just so you understand the Combine and backstory for Gordan Freeman and his friends, also G-Man.
