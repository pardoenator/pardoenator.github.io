    <h1 class="gametitlerating">15) Fallout 4</h1>
    <p class="gamereview">
	Fallout 4 is the newest instalment of the Fallout series. It has all of the elements from the previous 3D games (Fallout 3 and New Vegas). However, it has been repackaged with a new story line, 
	new engine, new location and has been combined with newer gameplay mechanics. The story line is a really good story however there are places where you can easily predict what is going to happen. 
	The gameplay still feels the same as the past two Fallout games, and it also gets easily repetitive, especially if you have played the past two 3D Fallout games. But that is not the reason it is 
	only 15 on my list. The main reason it is this low on my list is the fact that even after half a year since it's release it is still quite bug ridden. Another reason that it is so low down on my 
	list is the compatibility of the engine, it does not support SLi by default, so you have to force it through the NVidia Control Panel and if you have a widescreen monitor, you have to modify the 
	games config file to run at the resolution of the monitor. Apart from those few problems the game is still a fun game to play and if you enjoyed the past games then you will 
	obviously love this 
	game.

<h1 class="gametitlerating">14) Assassin's Creed - Syndicate
</h1>
    <p class="gamereview">
		I am not a big fan of the Assassin's Creed series, that said when I started to play the series with Assassin's Creed 3 I started to love the game, then it got better from there with Assassin's 
		Creed 4 - Black Flag. Then I played the latest AC game, Syndicate. I mainly wanted to play this game because it was based in London, and I like the idea of basing it around the time of the 
		Industrial Revolution. The gameplay is essentially like the other AC games, however, it adds certain aspects to the overall series. Like being able to complete missions as either Jacob or Evie
		Frye. Another good point about the AC series in general is that you can meet famous people from that area and time period. If you have played the previous AC games then you will love this latest
		instalment to the series, especially if you live in the UK.

<h1 class="gametitlerating">13) Burnout Paradise - The Ultimate Box</h1>
<p class="gamereview">
This is obviously the best racing game that has been made, not only is it a sandbox so you do what you like in the Paradise City, the physics are really good especially when it comes to
the crashes. Burnout Paradise is one of the best games Criterion have come up with and they still have not created a better game since. The map has a 
variety of areas, from mountains, to
beach and downtown areas. There are times where the city does not feel lived in 
because not enough cars spawn, but this is so you can have more fun with your chosen car. The idea of getting
your car from the scrapyard is another unique thing about this game. You have to make the opponent crash before you get their car from the scrap yard, then you take the car to the Auto-Repair
shop and it is yours to do as you please. There is also a big variety of cars, from saloons, to Monster Trucks to Police Cars and even cars from movies if you have the Legendary Cars DLC.

<h1 class="gametitlerating">12) Mafia 2</h1>
<p class="gamereview">
Mafia 2 is another highly recommended game. This is because it has a great story element, a great gameplay element and the map is another unique feature of this game. You play a person who has 
just come back from deployment in WW2, you meet up with an old friend who gets you out of having to go back to the frontlines. Things happen you get betrayed by the first Mafia family you are 
working for, you go to prison, come out and start working for them and become a part of their family. The setting is a unique feature not only is it set in the 1940's and 50's, so you get to 
listen to the great music of the time, it is set in a fictional city called Empire Bay, which takes parts from real American Cities and melds them together, which they have done a good job doing.
The only downside for this game is the fact that it is still on the Steam Store but you are unable to buy the game or even see a price for it. It is also the same for the DLC's even if you already 
have the game. Apart from that it is still a great game that has loads of unique features.

<h1 class="gametitlerating">11) Euro Truck Simulator 2
</h1>
<p class="gamereview">
Yes, again with the Truck Simulator, I know. I brought ETS1 because it was going cheap so I thought why not try it. I am glad I did try it. It is a great game. Relaxing driving a truck around Europe, 
looking at the great visuals in the game. There are some downsides to it, for example you are unable to get out of the truck like you can in GTA. But if you just look at the 
simulation and experience 
you will be greatly impressed. All of the simulation you would expect is there, from the power and feel of the truck, to the use of retarders and the gear ratio. It is all there and works and feels 
like you are actually driving a truck, especially with a Logitech G29 and a Track IR system or 
Oculus VR system. I highly suggest getting this game, especially if you are into trucks and simulators.
