    <h1 class="gametitlerating">20) Elite: Dangerous</h1>
    <p class="gamereview">
    Elite Dangerous is a great game. If you like Space simulations or played the original Elite in the 80's, then this is a must get. Not only is space simulated realistically, so for example, the 
    fact there is no up in space and gravity simulation. The whole Milky Way galaxy is in the game on a 1:1 scale. So this means that all of the known parts of the Milky Way are there and even 
    more since it is set in the future. So Humans have colonized most of he Galaxy, there are stations where you can dock and trade with, pirates and the factions. There are even undiscovered 
    parts of the galaxy, so if you come across a undiscovered solar system then you get to name it what ever you want. Even our solar system Sol is in the game, however, you do need a lot of money
    to gain access to the area or be a high rank in the Federation, but is 
	<span lang="en-gb"></span>worth it. It is a lot better with the Horizons add-on, this enables you to land on the planets and moons and use a space
    rover to travel across the surface, however this is only planets and moons with little or no atmosphere, so you cannot yet land on 
	Terraformed Mars.

<h1 class="gametitlerating">19) American Truck Simulator</h1>
    <p class="gamereview">
		Yes, I said it American Truck Simulator in a top 20 list of games. I know that most people that see ATS and think no that is not a game for me, but that is what I thought when 
		I first saw it, 
		and then I gave ETS a try and I got hooked on the gameplay. This was because the gameplay pace is very calming compared to games where you keep shooting enemies over and over again. I know 
		that there is not much content for the game because it is new but 
		despite that it is still a decent game. If you have played Euro Truck Simulator 2, then you should defiantly check this game
		out. It is like ETS2 but based in America, so the maps have the American feel, in that everything is dirty, 
		<span lang="en-gb"></span>on and rugged unlike the Europe maps which are clean and look brand new. 
		The reason it is not higher on my list with ETS2 is because of the fact that there is not much content yet, but as more content gets created by SCS and mod authors then it will become a lot 
		bigger and better.

<h1 class="gametitlerating">18) Medal Of Honor: Warfighter</h1>
<p class="gamereview">
This is another game where you will think I'm not a normal gamer, this is 
because all other review sites has marked this game down for various reasons. But 
I personally think that it is a good game. 
and this is odd for me because I don't normally like linear shooters where you are forced to take a certain approach to completing the mission. But there is something about this game 
that makes me want to come back and replay this game. The graphics are beautiful and it is the same with the parts of the gameplay. The simulation is also there, so when you shoot the
bullet out of the sniper rifle you have to make sure that you account for the distance because the bullet will drop under the force of gravity. There is only one problem which I marked
the game down on is the fact that on two driving scenes the cars did not feel like cars, they looked like it but they did not have much physics with them, but this is mainly a shooter 
so this is not much of a issue.

<h1 class="gametitlerating">17) Need For Speed - Rivals</h1>
<p class="gamereview">
I know that this is not the best Need For Speed game, I also like the 2010 version of Hot Pursuit and many others I have had a 
chance to play in the past. But I find for some reason I 
keep coming back to this one and want to play it again. This game is a lot like Hot Pursuit, except that there are new cars and a bigger map to mess around on. The cars feel like the 
cars in the past Need For Speed game, meaning not very realistic and able to transfer skills from one to the other, but you do feel the power difference more than the past games. The 
map is a mixture of different areas, snow at the top, a desert area, seaside and forest. This adds to the diversity of the map, making it feel that bit bigger and adds more options to 
the game play.

<h1 class="gametitlerating">16) Left 4 Dead 2</h1>
<p class="gamereview">
Left 4 Dead 2 is a great and probably the best zombie shooter out there. It has everything you want in a zombie shooter, zombies, guns, an apocalypse and a Fire axe. What more would 
you want in a game like this. There are a wide variety of mods to increase the gameplay. There is also a co-op so if you get fed up with the basic AI, you can invite some friends online
an have them as your team. There are only two reasons why it is not higher on my list, one is that there are not much 
variety in weapons and zombies and the second reason is that 
after a while the gameplay does get repetitive, since there is not much of a 
variety in the base game. however, if you like killing zombies then this is a highly 
recommended game to play.
